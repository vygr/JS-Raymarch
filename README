JS-Raymarch By Chris Hinsley 2016
=================================

JavaScript/HTML/WebGL Raymarch test.

I gathered several bits of code from the web, demo scene etc to put together
this test, mainly to grok the concepts myself. To all those in the demo scene,
you know who you are, that shared code and concepts to enable others to do this,
thank you.

I'm going to turn this into a ShaderToy example at some point, got a plan to do
something cool...

You can run the app by simply going to https://vygr.github.io/JS-Raymarch

Enjoy.

Chris
